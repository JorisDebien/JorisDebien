- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JorisDebien
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software testing, engineering management, and the people behind the software.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™ve started curating a list of resources I frequently use in my job as engineering manager.
- ğŸ“– I've written a [guide to work with myself](https://github.com/JorisDebien/JorisDebien/blob/main/ShortGuide.md) that I share from company to company.
