# A short guide to Joris
This is a user guide to me and how I work. It aims to provide some sort of insights to people - direct reports, peers, managers and anyone in between - on how I measure my success and the success of people around me, and on how I usually do my work. While it would be great to speedrun a connection using this guide, I just hope it helps even a tiny little bit.

## Key Principles
> These are the principles that guide my decision making and behaviour at work. 

### ü´∂ Humans first
I firmly believe happy, informed and productive people build amazing products. Other managers might optimize for the business, the technology, etc; and while a company needs those viewpoints, my bias is towards happy and productive people.

### ‚öñÔ∏è We're dealing with systems
Systems are everything and everything is a system. I think and work in flowcharts and models to understand complex things. Inefficiencies in these systems can drive me crazy, and I will definitely want to fix them - with your help.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Default to delegation
I believe delegation is an extremely effective way of building trust and high performance. If I delegate something to you, it's because I believe you can handle this - but I might be wrong. It might be too big, too confusing, or simply too risky for you, and you should tell me. I will always help.

### üí™ Bias for action
I believe starting something is the best way to learn, but I also believe this isn't always the best way of handling things. I can get impatient with long debates over potential directions. 

### üî¨ Knowledge is everything
Building and sharing knowledge is often top-of-mind for me. You will get nudges to share your knowledge with the wider team and/or world. I believe I can wear anyone down into sharing their knowledge if I annoy them enough.

### üëÄ Curiosity & Critique
I'm always very eager to hear ideas, but I believe the best way to improve ideas is to tear them apart and find the gaps. This might come off as extremely stand-offish or even aggressive, and I don't always realize I'm doing that.

## My Behaviour
> Some nuances and observations. Some of these things might frustrate you. Tell me if they do. 

- **I'm -very- introverted.** One-on-ones are perfect, and team settings I can handle. Anything above 8 people and I tend to get quiet. This isn't lack of enthousiasm or engagement - groups of people are just a lot of work for me.
- **I think out loud.** You‚Äôll often hear me rejecting my own ideas. I can (and probably will) get lost in my own train of thought.
- **I tend to speak in hyperbole.** This is mostly because I'm enthousiastic or passionate about a subject. I also swear sometimes. Sorry?
- **I will never not make jokes.** This isn't me not taking my work seriously, it's a way for me to set the tone.
- **I'm in constant growth mode.** I'm always looking for the next improvement to a fault. I‚Äôm trying to get better at also appreciating what we have at the moment, but it‚Äôs not my default.
- **I have a poor memory.** I have systems in place to keep things moving, but it happens more than I like that things fall through the cracks. Tell me if I‚Äôm forgetting something, I promise it‚Äôs not my intention.
- In contrast to the previous point, I brainstorm a lot and move from idea to idea ‚Äî ooh, shiny new thing. Yes, I am causing my own demise.

## For Direct Reports
> Useful info if you're my direct report

### My Expectations

- I need you to take initiative and somewhat self-manage. I expect a higher-than-average level of autonomy. Just do it. I've got your back if things should go wrong. 
- I‚Äôd rather you try and fail, than not try at all. Failure is how we learn.
- If I don‚Äôt hear anything from you, I assume everything is okay - even though it might not be. Never wait to tell me of issues you're struggling with, I'm here to help. 

### Our 1-on-1s

- Our 1-on-1 time revolves around one question: how are you?
- I relate to other people‚Äôs experiences by sharing my own similar-feeling experiences and anecdotes. If this comes across as always wanting to talk about myself, it's definitely not my intention.
- If I don't know, I can't respond or react. I don't care how you say something to me in a 1-on-1 setting. The only thing I care about is that you say it. I'd rather you scream at me in anger than not say anything at all.
- If you don't have any topics, we can always talk about how you could share your knowledge to the rest of engineering, or how we can take the next step in your career.
- Talk to me about your dreams and passions. Chances are that there's an opportunity lying in wait.

## My Expectations
- I have very high expectations of you, as I do of myself - sometimes too high. 
- Integrity & fairness is extremely important to me.
